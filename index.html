      <p>
        Hidden behind a bookshelf at <strong>2113 E Main Street, Richmond, VA 23223</strong>, this Prohibition-style speakeasy delivers vintage charm and modern mixology. The ambiance is rich with velvet, mystery, and literary flair — but the real legend is their <strong>Smoked Old Fashioned</strong>, widely hailed as the best in the city. Served with aromatic smoke and precision, it’s a ritual as much as a drink.
